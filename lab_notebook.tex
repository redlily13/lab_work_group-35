\section*{Java Swing Application: SymbolApp}
This document describes the Java Swing application named \texttt{SymbolApp}. The application showcases a simple "mind-reading" trick by displaying a grid of symbols and revealing a selected symbol based on user interaction. This document is formatted using LaTeX to provide a clear and professional presentation for academic purposes.

\section*{1. Clone the Repository}
The first step involved cloning the repository from the URL: \url{https://github.com/GeekAyan/STT} using GitHub Desktop. 
I opened GitHub Desktop and navigated to the "File" menu. From there, I selected "Clone Repository" and pasted the URL into the corresponding field. After specifying my local directory where the repository would be cloned, I clicked "Clone" to download the project files onto my local machine. This provided access to the source code and all project dependencies.

\section*{2. Set Up the Project}
Next, I opened the project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a versatile code editor. The setup process involved reading through the \texttt{README.md} file, which provided detailed instructions for running the application. The instructions guided me through several steps, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Installing any required dependencies using a package manager such as Maven or Gradle, depending on the project's setup.
    \item Ensuring that I had the correct version of Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
    \item Setting up any required environment variables for the application to run properly.
\end{itemize}
I followed these steps to ensure my development environment was correctly configured before running the application.
\section*{3. Run the Application}
Once the project was set up, I proceeded to run the application. The \texttt{README.md} provided the necessary commands for building and executing the project. In this case, I used the following command from the terminal:
\begin{verbatim}
    javac SymbolApp.java
    java SymbolApp
\end{verbatim}
\newpage
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture, overlay]
    \draw[line width = 2pt, black] 
        ($(current page.north west) + (1cm,-1cm)$) 
        rectangle 
        ($(current page.south east) + (-1cm,1cm)$);
\end{tikzpicture}
\vspace{-1.2cm}

These commands compiled the \texttt{SymbolApp.java} file and executed the resulting class file. I verified that the application ran as expected, displaying the main user interface with the grid of symbols and the interactive button.

\section*{4. Modify the Button}
\hspace{1.5cm}
The applicationâ€™s user interface includes a button that the user clicks to reveal their "selected" symbol. To personalize and improve the button, I made the following modifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Located the button's code within the \texttt{SymbolApp.java} file. The button was initialized using Javaâ€™s AWT \texttt{Button} class and labeled with default text.
    \item I modified the buttonâ€™s text from its original label to a more engaging phrase: \textbf{"Chin Tapak Dum Dum"}.
    \item This required updating the following line of code:
    \begin{verbatim}
        submitButton = new Button("Chin Tapak Dum Dum");
    \end{verbatim}
    This change improved the interaction with the user by introducing a fun, customized message.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Code Description}
\hspace{1.5cm}
The \texttt{SymbolApp} class extends \texttt{Frame} and implements \texttt{ActionListener}, allowing it to respond to user actions like button clicks. It generates a random "special" symbol, which is displayed among other symbols in a 99-symbol grid. The special symbol is placed at multiples of 9. When the user clicks the button, the application reveals the special symbol, creating the illusion that the app has "read" the user's mind and guessed their chosen symbol.

\subsection*{Key Code Modifications}
\hspace{1.5cm}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The button text was updated to \textbf{"Chin Tapak Dum Dum"} to make the user interaction more playful and entertaining.
    \item The buttonâ€™s size was modified using \texttt{setPreferredSize()}, while the font style was adjusted with \texttt{setFont()} to ensure optimal proportions and better readability on the interface.
    \item The buttonâ€™s core functionality remained unchanged, allowing users to click it and reveal their selected symbol, maintaining the applicationâ€™s interactive experience.
\end{enumerate}

% Content
\noindent
LaTeX is a powerful document preparation system widely used in academia, research, and professional publishing. It is based on the TeX typesetting system and allows users to create high-quality documents, including articles, books, reports, and presentations. LaTeX is particularly popular in fields that require complex formatting, such as mathematics, physics, and computer science, due to its superior handling of formulas, citations, and references. LaTeX separates content from formatting, allowing writers to focus on the content itself while the system ensures consistent and professional typesetting.

\vspace{0.5cm} % Reduced space

% Usage Section
\noindent
\textbf{\Large Usage}

\vspace{0.3cm} % Reduced space

\noindent
Using LaTeX begins with writing plain text in a source file, which contains both the content of the document and LaTeX commands for formatting. LaTeX files typically have a \texttt{.tex} extension. To compile a LaTeX document, a LaTeX distribution (such as \texttt{TeXLive} or \texttt{MikTeX}) is used, converting the source file into a well-formatted PDF output.

\vspace{0.2cm}

The system excels at managing references, creating bibliographies, and producing structured documents such as theses and dissertations. Users define sections, equations, tables, and figures using simple commands, and LaTeX ensures they are consistently formatted throughout the document.

Moreover, LaTeX supports various packages that extend its functionality, such as \texttt{amsmath} for mathematical notation and \texttt{graphicx} for including images. Many integrated development environments (IDEs) like Overleaf, TeXShop, and Texmaker simplify the process of writing and compiling LaTeX documents.

\vspace{0.3cm} % Reduced space

In summary, LaTeX is a versatile tool that ensures professional-quality typesetting while providing flexibility and control over complex document formatting. It is invaluable for writers in technical fields or anyone looking to produce polished, well-organized documents.

\subsection*{\Huge{Write-Up: Experience with Git Branching and Merging}}
\\\
\paragraph {This assignment focused on the use of Git branching and merging to manage features in a collaborative environment. After creating separate branches for feature-1 and feature-2, each was developed independently.
When merging feature-1 into the main branch, there were no conflicts. However, the merge of feature-2 caused a conflict in the shared.txt file. Conflict resolution was done manually, ensuring that the changes from both branches were retained.
The practical experience highlighted the importance of clear commit messages and Gitâ€™s branching capabilities for parallel development and conflict management.}
